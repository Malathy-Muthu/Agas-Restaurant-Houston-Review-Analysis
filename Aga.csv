review_text"Ordered through Ubereats, great customer service at the restaurant, perfectly packaged, food was fresh and delicious! Prices were perfect even through UE! Will order again!"Really COVID ready. Quick and friendly service. Food was awesome and very distinct flavors. Worth a visit."I have been going to Aga’s for last 10 years. Food
Quality was excellent but for last 1 year the quality went down the drain. Meat looks like it’s been re heated several times and smells bad. Last I ordered was on 12/04/2020 thinking they improved but the whole family didn’t like. It’s not one dish but all 7 dishes from the menu was worst. Never going back to this place. Would give - 5 stars."Khadija was a gr8 server to our party of 10. Very helpful and friendly. Gr8 food and environment.Best Indian food hands down for Houston.   They have far exceeded our expectations.  The goat chops are amazing ??  Khatija is awesome !I think my order was mixed up with a lamb chop dish because I was given raw onions and carrots instead of rice with my chicken tikka masala. I took a few bites and couldn’t finish the dish I threw up the few bites I did take.Tasty Biryani. Not typical Pakistani oily Biryanis.Chicken Makhani & Mithai Chaat = Best.  Ask for less Spice."Excellent food, I recommend the new shrimp tomato base curry entree and the chicken curry. Garlic naan too. Yum! Very clean and quick. Mint lemonade too."Very good service and our Bhai Sufiyan was very helpful and very nice. And very good Chops.Amazing foodGreat Taste and Service . . ."Totally stellar food, the best Indo-Pak food I ever ate. We had the goat chops, chicken makhani, goat biryani, and the vegetable pulao. It would be hard to improve on any of the dishes, though the goat chops really are something special!""This is the best Pakistani restaurant in Texas. My family and I have been to many Pakistani restaurants in Miami, DC, and Tennessee, but this is the best one by far.
The food comes super fast but doesn’t decrease the mouth watering deliciousness. If you decide to come here you have to ask for Rizwan and Andrea because they are so kind.
A must have is the goat chops they are moist, tender, and well seasoned. Come check it out and you will always come back!
We also had the opportunity to meet the owner, who was extremely friendly, genuine and a welcoming person. ????""This is the best Pakistani restaurant! We have been to many others in DC, Miami, Virginia but this one stands out! Excellent service and superb food.   Rizwan and Andrea took the  best care of us! You  have to  come here!!! The goat chops are so good! If u don’t u are missing out!"This place clearly knows what it’s doing. The food phenomenal and is well priced. The service is top notch and I don’t have any complaints. The goat chops are extremely good as well!"I can’t say enough good things about Agas! The food is consistently fresh and incredibly flavorful. The service is always excellent, the staff is attentive and friendly. Hussein was amazing during the recent visit, but every server I have had there has been wonderful. Always recommend!"Just had food at agas and the food was amazing! They served us a generous amount of food plus the staff here is so friendly specially this guy rizwan was super friendly. Amazing experience"The food was absolutely delicious! We had a beautiful experience here and the customer service was amazing. We had goat chops, beef nihari, followed by a perfect cup of tea and Mithai Chaat Kulfi for dessert. Thank you, I'll be coming back soon!"Amazing food and service. You should try lamp chop its very very good really liked it and they also had kids menu which is helpful since I have 2 small kids.Wow what a test .."Love the food and staff BUT giving them 1 star because they went away with curbside. Additionally, to get inside to pick up food, you still have to typically stand in line before you can grab your pickup order. When inquired why they went away, the owner mentioned that customers were parking in the pick up spots. Instead of enforcing better parking or towing those cars, they simply went away with curbside. I think that's an outrageous policy as the pandemic is the worst it has ever been and 6 months into it, they got rid of curbside.  Very very disappointed as this place was a gold standard for desi places.

PS: taking temperature of asymptomatic people does nothing to prevent the spread of the virus."One of the best restaurants in Houstan. We go everytime up there when we visit houstan"Favorite restaurant in Houston! I just walk in now and ask the manager what I should get, and the recommended dish never fails to impress. An absolute must-visit""After a lot of recommendations from my friends, my first time visit was excellent. The restaurant was neat and clean with strict COVID protocol. The food was served in a timely manner and tasted so good.yummy ??. The floor manager Sufiyan Patel was super friendly and customized  my order to suit my preferences. I would certainly recommended this restaurant to my friends !!!"Order 2 butter chicken they just gave us tomato pure with chicken in it. Worst experience everFood is always fresh & tasty. We do take out regularly.  Aga’s never disappoints!didn't delivery all our food and she said their policy is not to refund because they double check     do not get delivery unless you are at the door to make sure all is there   very sad because this our favorite Pakistani restaurantFood was delicious! Service is fast and kind. Prices are fair and portions are normal. Staff and restaurant were clean and tidy. Definitely recommendHad a great time this weekend! The Hyderabadi Karahi Gosht and Mango Lassi were fantastic and the service was excellent! A special thank you to both Hussain and Rizwan for the hospitality and fun conversation. Expect to be back very soon"Had a great time at Aga's ! Ordered the Goat Karahi and it was on point.

Service was excellent, shout out to Rizwan and Hussain, who were kind, courteous and made us feel at home."I recommend this restaurant is really good food.Indian food..full of flavors..tasteful..delicious...Posh..hygienic and big restaurant..up to date system..polite staff..Awesome ambience.....lovely experience... Best to call and reserve a table as the waiting time is high and it is crowded... if it is windy ?? then waiting outside the restaurant will be very uncomfortable and chilling.. Food is delicious so it’s worth to wait....5 star..ThanksExtremely content and happy with the food and service at this restaurant. Me and my friends enjoyed the authentic dishes they served out for us. Definitely would recommend and visit this place again"To add to the thousands of other positive reviews, this place is delicious. Incredible food with great flavor and tasty curry, friendly top notch service, and quality dining. You won’t regret stopping here!""The food is good but they need to get rid of the salesperson order taker that paces up and down the dining area past your table who continues to try and get you to try other things by saying, “you should try this” making it sound as though she is going to have you try something for free never mentioning she is suggesting you try another meal at a pretty high price to you.
It didn’t feel like good service rather it felt like a shark was swarming around my wallet as I ate!  They didn’t used to do that and they need to stop it or if they want to make suggestions they should mention the cost to you at the Same time instead of making it sound like they are giving you a sample of something. Bad business""Hmmm I’m a little confused about this. Did you guys change cooks or team for take-outs vs. dine in during this pandemic? Just to be clear Aga’s is my most favorite restaurant of all time but the last 4 times I did a delivery of various items, the food quality standards were not upto Aga’s mark. Today I ordered Haleem and Biryani and was really surprised as to how bland both tasted. Haleem was super watery and tasted like a old people’s soup. Biryani was missing salt and ratio of boti vs rice was really off. Naans were very soggy. Similar issues in the past 4 orders. Aga’s food used to be with such high standards that even if you warmed up the leftovers after 4 days it would still taste fresh and amazing.

Unfortunately I cannot dine-in until the pandemic is over but I will need to take a break from delivery as well now. The bar for Aga’s is set soooo high that it’s hard for me to be dissatisfied and disappointed 4 times in a row. I may update this review after sometime later when I order again and feel joyful to have my Aga’s standard back! Feeling bit letdown right now!"Most delicious and clean Pakistani/indian Halal Restaurant in greater houston"Best food and service in the industry. Absolutely phenomenal! The manager Surfiyan came to our table, asked how our meal was, and took an interest in our family. I recommend to anyone looking for great food, service, and atmosphere! We will definately be back. We just ate at Agas again...Friday, November 20th 2020... Once again the service is unbelievable and surfiyan is the best manager in Houston.... when you go,
You just have white curry, chicken lollipops, goat chips and chicken biryani! Best restaurant in Houston! Must taste! FirstLineNutritionevrydyheropodcast"Today I ordered food for take out and was very specific with the order that it should not contain any nuts and when I picked up the order I reminded them to make sure there is no nuts and they assured me and when I got home and gave it to my son he had severe reaction to the food and had to call the doctor . They don’t care of your allergies ! Be careful .I spoke to the manager and seems like the management has to educate everyone working on how serious the allergic reaction can be"Amazing food and service, local favorite."Great food and service.authantic indian foodThis was our first time here and won’t be the last! All the food that we ordered were very yummy! The goat karahi was excellent! Hussain and Ali were very attentive and very helpful with our orders! We even got our complimentary samosa which was also very yummy! Will definitely come back!"Changing to 1 Star as staff behavior is not at all good I usually go this restaurant 3 to 4 times in a week, As plz don’t order anything on promotion which they offering its not at all fresh as I said to the floor manager also instead of listening he was arguing started my day with bad experience,I got disappointed as it was my favorite restaurant, Thanks Jay""I ordered half tray haleem to go, i specifically asked before i ordered about how many people can eat, person on phone told me clearly 10 to 12 people easily, I come home open the tray, first it was not full all the way, it was 75% full, then people started taking after 6 people got plate,  there was no more, this was second time that same thing happened with the haleem tray."Halwa poori and nihari was awesome"Must visit!
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston because of its amazing food, good service and safety.
The indoor space is huge and so every other table is distanced from each other. The measure your temperature at entry and make sure that people don't crowd. The service is quick and they make sure that your concerns are addressed promptly.
I definitely recommend the following and these are the dishes which I usually order:
Chicken Bihari kabab: the chicken is so well marinated and cook that it melts in your mouth. I can finish it entirely by my self but you can share it between 2
Butter chicken kadai: this is a spicy version of the regular butter chicken and my personal favorite. The chicken is shredded and go well with the naan.
Goat biryani: every rice grain has a taste to it! Definitely it's worth a try if you haven't tasted and have room for more food.
There are definitely many other dishes worth giving a try. I am more of a 'chicken-person' and so all I have tried here are chicken dishes.""Very clean, very careful during covid and the food was delicious!!"Wow!!!!! Amazing customer ??service from ALI & a huge thanks for recommending the Goat Kabab White Karahi!!! The staff is so nice & respectful. My server Ashiyana was so sweet . AWESOME JOB ?? !!???????"Good service, very clean, food delicious., fresh and good taste... good restaurant ever try... definitely recommended it... you gonna love it... for sure we are coming back..."Karahi galore"The food is known to be very good, but we’re especially impressed by the service and ambiance. The restaurant is taking many precautions for COVID and we had minimal interactions with other diners or staff members. Our waitress Afsana was very attentive and was so accommodating when we realized we ordered a different dish than we were thinking of. Recommend the chicken kebab white karai and grilled goat chops!""The food was amazing. Goat chops and goat biryani, with a delicious mint lemonade.
To top that the customer services was the best, the manager (Sufiyan) came to introduce himself and ensured that our experience to be a delightful one. Going back asap.
You most try the goat chops!!!"Very good food!!!!

We had guests over from Chicago and we drove all the way from Dallas....hands down..theee best desi food in Houston. Noureen and Ali were awsome..always ask for them!! Good job guys..??????????"Wonderfull meal, friendly staff. Highly recommend this restaurant.""We've been many times in the past couple of months after a client told me about Aga's. EVERYTHING we have tried has been AMAZING!! And their cleanliness and service is top notch. Super Covid safe environment. They take your temp at the door and you are properly distanced. The White Karahi chicken and the white Karahi Kofta are probably my favorite DISHES ON THE PLANET and I have tasted many many things. Going back tomorrow to eat it for the 3rd time. EVERYTHING here is AMAZING no joke the BOMB DOT COM! Been dreaming of Aga's all week and my mouth is watering as I type this out. You know what, I may go tonight (and I live an hour away) its that good."AMAZINGGGG!!! Everything was splendid! From Food to customer service. Honestly one of the best places I’ve tried since I moved from NY. Definitely recommend Agas to anyone who’s looking to eat some delicious Pakistani food. People are very down to earth and provided such great service. Coming back soon!!!Very good food and well managed staff ."This place NEVER disappoints. Best customer service and delicious food. Every time my family and I visit Houston we make a point to stop here because they have THE BEST Indian food in Houston. Really good mango mojito, paneer shashlik, goat chops, and vegetarian curries! They also catered my engagement party and the whole process was very smooth and the owner was extremely accommodating to our wishes! Because of their catering our party was a success and our out of state guests still talk about how delicious the  food was a year later."Great customer service by Hussain and amazing  food. Definitely will be coming back!Amazing serviceWow loved the food very beautiful and clean restaurantAs good as it gets. Don't miss out on chops. Extremely clean restaurant with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Good masala chai."Our son was bragging about this restaurant so we ended up going to this restaurant for dinner. As we walked in, we were asked to sanitize our hands and also they took our body temperatures. The restaurant was super clean. The food we ordered was Lamb chops, Peshawari white kabob, Paneer bhurji and naan. The food wise every dish was very flavorful. THE CHOPS were incredibly tender, juicy and full of flavor. The service was equally good. The only regret is that we wish we knew about this restaurant sooner. Thanks to Rizwan and Afsana for taking of us."Consistent"Very good food

I tried the goat chops and I’ve never tried goat before but it was really , really good! As well as the fried shrimp, fries, and chicken corn soup. I had the pleasure of having Farhan serve us and he had amazing customer service!! Fast service, great workers, family oriented, and it has a quiet atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"Best Pakistani Restaurant in United States of America. Each and every dish delicious service also awesome 5 star. I wish they have branch in Austin tx in future.The best lamb chops ever!!! The taste is heavenly. I would really suggest everyone to try the lamb chops here. It’s taste worthy.You can never go wrong with agas!We ordered food with desert ras malai . To us it's big surprise when we saw the desert  it's just half little cup in other words just one spoon .. and we paid $4.99 for that . Greed has no limit at least advise the customer for serving quantity per order . Very disappointing experience ."Hussain and ayaz are very helpful. Being first time to dine in in Agas , not really familiar with menu, Hussain guide us and help us to make some good choices  . Goat chop is excellent.  Excellent Staff and  service . Thank you and keep up the good work."The food was amazing here the service was incredible and Sufyan took good care of usWow delicious the best"PERFECTION. That easy. The food was superb and the service was astounding, they're taking very noticeable covid measures to keep you safe which shows the dedication and care for their clients.""Absolutely outstanding. Someone we were with who is from India recommended the place and told us which dishes were best. We had goat mutton chop, chicken biryani, garlic naan, and some other dishes that were fantastic but that I couldn’t remember the name of.

Every - single - dish was outstanding. Full of spices and flavor, and just cooked perfectly. We were talking about it for hours after the meal ended.

The service was also stellar. We thought that the person who served us was the owner due to how attentive and gracious he was. Incredibly friendly and had some great recommendations.

I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone. It was among the best dining experiences I’ve ever had and would eagerly take someone here.

Thanks so much for the great experience."Very nice lunch there. Hussain was really helpful and gave us great advice. We enjoyed all the different dishes we tried (from starters to dessert).

Everything was delicious and what made everything better was the amazing service/staff! Everyone is so nice and helpful! The supervisor SUFIYAN was most of all incredible! He walked us through the menu and recommended items which is why we ordered what we did and we are so happy we did! He really made us feel special and gave us the “full experience.” We can’t wait to bring some friends and family to eat with us here!""This is a great restaurant with superior customer service, Afsana and Restaurant Supervisor, Sufiyan made sure our dining experience was exquisite.

syed Atif""First time here and oh my, how delicious, service was great and i will be going back....mmmmm

So, my 1st time co.ing was 3 years ago and I still give this wonderful restaurant 5 stars. Never ever disappointed. Came out to eat last week here with my Friend/sister for her Birthday, and as always, they were so welcoming, so helpful, so kind and just an all around blessing to us both. Very sincere. Delicious food! Refreshing Mint Lemonades. Excellent service. Great management.

2.5 years ago I happened to serve the owners at Olive Garden. I had no idea they were the owners when they asked if we had any kind of rice to substitute the pasta for. I told them no, but if they like rice, they should try AGA's. They were like, really?! What else do you like from there? I told them...and after I went on and on, they then let me know they happened to be the owners of Aga's. Till this day, you all are still my favorite place.""Great food, helpful service, nice portions.  It seems like their meat quality and taste have improved from last year.  We ordered chops (price increased),  balti gost,  goat karahi.  Every dish was good.""I don’t say this lightly but Aga’s is the best Pakistani food outside of Pakistan, that I’ve ever had in the world. Top notch service, presentation, and quality. Every dish is paired with the right sauces and garnishes. The service is better than most 5 star and Michelin star restaurants I’ve been to. Go to Aga’s and ask for Sofian and let him order for you. You’ll see why I consider Aga’s to be that damn good."Tasty Food and very good service.Really great food but a bit in the expensive sideBest Goat chops in town. I was visiting first time and loved it. It will be my go to stop on texas visits.Amazing Goat Chops and the karahi selection is wonderful. Great service and attention to detail."EXCELLANT FOOD!, my friend and I had lunch today, we had Aga's grill, Goat Karahi, Brain Masala, all excellant. nice young Goat.

Would come here again, and recommend."We have been coming to this joint over the past 10 years. The food and service is always impeccable. I loved the fact that our polite server Ali was keen to reccomend the newest dishes on the menu. Everytime i come here i honestly feel like i would be dining at my own familys restaurant. Great job on providing quality and consistency."In addition to the amazing food, the service was SPOT ON.
Our servers Ali & Afsana went above and beyond to provide 10/10 experience! If you ever have trouble, they would help you without any hesitation.

We will definitely come again, because the food and the service was the BEST!!""This spot is delicious and every time I come through from Dallas, it’s my go to place for delicious Pakistani food. It’s always fresh and the taste is consistent. Service is above excellent. I haven’t experienced service like this in any of the Dallas Indian/Pakistani  restaurants. Hussain and Rizwan are amazing hosts and catered to our every needs. Amazing experience! Each time and every time! Thanks, Aga’s!"We came during the COVID pandemic.  They take each customer's temperature and seat them socially distant from one table to another. The food is exceedingly superb and they have outstanding customer service.

Will be here in the future!ali was best waiter and the service was great and he was very nice to our group. We will def come again"Aga’s is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston. If it was based on the food alone, I would give it 5+ stars every time. The goat chops are my favorite thing on the menu, but I recently tried the grilled wings and fell in love all over again. Now add in the service, the ambiance and the beauty of the restaurant itself and I’m here wishing I could give 10 stars. Ali was a perfect host, super attentive and helped us make excellent decisions on new items to try. I also love that you can rent spaces here for events and use the restaurant for catering. What more can you ask for? If you haven’t tried Aga’s, don’t wait another second!"Loved the customer services and the goat dishes were really good. Will be returning.Hussein took care of us. He was very attentive to our needs giving us his very knowledgeable recommendations. We want to thank him for his attentive care that he gave us."This is one of the few(2 or 3) Pak restaurant we order food from.  They have been consistent in Makin extremely tasty food for the 5 years I've been eating here or getting from here.  Place is very clean and they enforce social distancing measures.
Service is fast for in-person dining or takeout.  My favorite items here are:
- goat biryani (chicken biryani too)

- paneer butter masala
- karahi cashew chicken (bit oily, but the best)
- chicken tandoori masala
-. Bullet and garlic naans""Great foods

Perfect family/ formal dinner spot.""Dry chops and dry biriyani
Good naan
Goat curries alright""I love this place, today was my third time coming In a matter on two weeks. The quality of the food is fresh, flavorful, and authentic. They have great hospitality. Sufiyan And Ali,  amaze me with their great recommendations. I wish I knew the Chefs!! Because they have amazing hands In making this great food. Thank you all!!""Fantastic first time experience! My wife and I have not been to a restaurant since the whole COVID-19 situation began. So, for our first “let’s do
something normal” attempt, we chose Agas. Not only was the restaurant extremely clean and comfortable, the service was amazing. Mr. Sufiyan Patel provided us probably the best service I’ve had in over a couple years. He walked us thru the menu, and gave us tips on what to order.

The service was great! The food, even BETTER. I’m pretty skeptical when it comes to Eastern cuisine. However, the dishes we ordered were absolutely delicious. The flavors were deep but not too overwhelming. I’ll definitely be returning. Thank you for the great experience Aga team!"Fantastic food.  No waiting if you go early evening"My friend wanted to go eat some good food, so we met at Aga's! Our waiter ALI was amazing.  He recommended some really tasty dishes.  We had Tikka masala, Basmati rice, Garlic Naan, Goat Chops and Goat Peshawari Karahi! My friend and I were so happy and fuller than a tic. Subina also made sure we were well taken cared of.""Where do I begin, this is the second time im writing this review just to make sure my spelling is correct; you definitely want to read this. Aga's is special because when you order food you realize that it's not something you can find in any other market. It was my birthday on the 21st of oct. and Sufyan was the most brilliant floor manager I've ever met. There is a negative stigma behind eating at eastern world or other wild restaurants, but being an Arab myself, and having countless meat dishing im actually happy to say that their goat chops are top 3 in my lifetime. That means put of that hundreds, possibly thpusands pf times ive had lamb and goat this ranks in the best 3. Unless its fine dining i dont tip more than 8-15%, but i swear for a non fine dining experience i tipped more because Sufyan made me feel like a family member at their establishment and that was something thats hard to find even at the top luxury establishments. Take it from someone whos experienced when it comesnto gpod food and great service i promise you will get every penny spent at Aga's dining experience. Thank you Sufyan and Aga's managementfor making something so attractive at a reasonable price.""Where do I begin, this is the secobd time im writing this review just to make sure my spelling is correct; you definitely want to read this.

There is a negative stigma behind eating at eastern world or other wild restaurants, but being an Arab myself, and having countless meat dishing im actually happy to say that their goat chops are top 3 in my lifetime. That means put of that hundreds, possibly thpusands pf times ive had lamb and goat this ranks in the best 3. Unless its fine dining i dont tip more than 8-15%, but i swear for a non fine dining experience i tipped more because Sufyan made me feel like a family member at their establishment and that was something thats hard to find even at the top luxury establishments. Take it from someone whos experienced when it comesnto gpod food and great service i promise you will get every penny spent at Aga's dining experience. Thank you Sufyan and Aga's managementfor making something so attractive at a reasonable price."Chicken Biryani and Garlic Naan bread was soo good and authentic.Probably the best desi food you'll ever eat!!! Great customer service!"i placed to go order of some food and i am long time customer and this time they disappointed me.
They told me this sweet dish serving is for 4 people but quantity is very less. like only one person can eat.
i call them back and they asking me for picture of the food. i am long time customer and they dont have trust or anything like that really bad aga's restaurant."I went there today with a couple of my friends. The food was delicious and service was great. Ali took care of us and made sure our experience was wonderful. Thank You Ali...... I would definitely recommend this restaurant ."26 Sept 20 - Great food and good service.  Amisha helped us with our order and she got the right amount of spiciness for the curries.  Delicious goat chops.  We have introduced this place to other friends and we have kept coming back.

16 Oct 20 - We ordered take out for dinner. Order #555.  Our goat chops were very thin and hardly any meat on it.  Disappointed with the chops.""I asked for mild food, and it was very spicy. I’ve been to several Indian restaurants and most understand. This place questioned me as if I wasn’t going to pick up my foods. The restaurant itself is nice, which is why I gave it a 2."Always tasty food and excellent serviceIt’s a great place for food with a professional service. I really enjoy Agas restaurant. Thank you “Ali “to giving me the best service .Dining at this establishment was a great experience! The signature goat chops were impeccably delicious.

The floor manager, Sufiyan, was very helpful in helping us choose dishes. Everything was so full of flavor and cooked perfectly. The atmosphere was very clean and inviting and the customer service was probably the best I have ever experienced.

No wonder everyone raves about Aga's in and outside of Houston!"Thoroughly enjoyed our recent experience. I’ve been to Pak/Indian restaurants in Dallas, NYC and Chicago. No other place comes even close to what Aga’s offers. Perfect and consistent taste, meticulous hygiene protocol and 5 star customer service. Ms Naureen was our hostess and we requested for mild spice level due to some health issues- she went out of her way to get the food specially prepared for us to our liking. She made sure we got what we wanted and that mild spice didn’t mean no flavor. Mr Sufiyan the floor manager also came by to welcome us and to make sure our needs were met. Have never seen such customer service at a desi restaurant.""Agas is amazing! Best indo-pak you can get in the Houston area!

I visit here time and again for their exceptional food and great service!
We had been here for lunch on a weekend and the place was full and busy but because the restaurant itself is huge, it didn't seem crowded or risky to be eating indoors here. The tables were well spaced out, the cleaning between customers was done with diligence, there was ample staff and appropriate COVID-19 safety precautions were in place. We could even pay for our meal online via our phones.
The service was very prompt and polite!
We ordered the chicken bihari kebabs, butter chicken handi (shredded) and butter garlic naan. The food is absolutely tasty, just enough spicy and full of flavor! The chicken kebabs were succulent and so tender! For the taste, quantity and quality of food, it was value for money!
The entire experience was totally faultless, just above and beyond!"The restaurant was very clean. The wait staff was great.  They checked on us regularly making sure we didn't need anything.  But the best part is the food. Simply amazing. A must try is the bbq goat ribs. So good.Amazing food. Good spread. Great ambience. Warm hospitality. Clean and safe.

At the entrance i was greeted by floor manager (SP) and got my temperature taken to make sure the safety of everyone else in the room. The hospitality was amazing, Afsana and Aiyaz waited my table and service was one it's own class. It was a great experience and would definitely recommend anyone who wants to come out of this COVID frustration being at home. TOTALLY ENJOYED"Good place and good food but I wished we could get buy 1 get one free deal like other places doAmazing food and awesome service by the floor manager. I enjoyed it with family and will definitely be backGreat Food and Great service . Will come back next time .

I had Goat Biryani, and butter chicken..
And for dessert we had Kulfi Falooda and it was unusual. It had some spices but it was okay for me but my wife loved it.

Mango lassi was our drink (yummy) along with the Pakistani chai that we had after food with the dessert.

It's simply a place I'd go over and over again to.

5 stars earned."It’s a real treat ??Food is 100% tasty. Every dish is fresh and awesome in taste. 4 star because the Quantity is very less compared to all other restaurants and prices are also very high.

I simply ordered online, arrived at the parking lot, called the restaurant and they brought the order out. We thought an item was missing when we returned home and called the restaurant for assistance. We spoke with Mr. Hussain who was very kind and helpful, and confident in the accuracy of the order.

All the social distancing rules were followed, the staff wore gloves and masks, the interior was kept really clean..  would absolutely recommend this to everyone."Poor customer service and I found 2 baby insect in my food and I told the manager about it and they didn't do anything about itHorrible service"Superb service and staff.

Great food. They made wonderful recommendations.

A very pleasant experience overall. :)""The food was absolutely incredible and the service was just as good even with the place being packed.

The little touches added to the rating.  Basic things like bringing cold and room temperature water to each table was a nice touch. . The simple yet fresh salad.""At first, I gave this 5 star rating without describing why, usually because I'm not big into writing reviews, but let me elaborate. I've been here 6-7 times, mostly to dine in with my family. We try to order different things every visit but we always order the goat chops (best thing on the menu!) along with a veg and non-veg curry, plus the goat biryani. Mango mojito (non-alcoholic, as alcohol is not served here) is a go-to that provides that sweet, acidic kick to balance out the spice and richness in the food. The hostess is always polite and welcoming. Even when faced with lines down the sidewalk, the wait isn't too bad - 20 minutes - even on Eid. The place is always packed but obviously with coronavirus they have obey local ordinances, and have done so by distancing tables and seats, and placing ""please stay 6 feet apart"" social-distancing mats on the floor. Masks and gloves are donned on every worker, plates and glasses are held on the bottom to avoid touching areas you would contact. The other few times I have visited were to have discussions about catering for my wedding. Ramiz has been nothing but courteous, flexible, and accommodating. The staff are professional and go above-and-beyond. I only wish for things to go back to normal so I can go back to my monthly visits"The best lamb chops and chicken malai boti in Houston. The restaurant was just opened back from COVID-19 and they take safety seriously. They make sure all customers and employees wear masks and as I entered the restaurant they took temperature of all of us. I saw few members only focus on cleaning and sanitizing the restaurant. Agas has set the standard high."Goat chops. You'll dream about it.

Also great service, and it feels like they're handling covid very professionaly. Super clean, affordable, and delicious.""AGAIN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE

AFTER THEY REOPEND EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE BY NOOREN DELCIOUS FOOD.""Awesome Goat Chhops..
I would advise the white curry as well.
Overall great experience.""The food was sooo amazing! And the service is impeccable, Sufiyan was extremely kind to my family and I and very hospitable. Not a single complaint. A must for anyone who’s craving incredible desi food!!""As this was my first time trying indian food, I have to say, I was very impressed! The restaurant is beautiful and clean. The food was delicious even though I have nothing to compare it to since this was my first time eating indian cuisine. I'm glad I've chosen Aga's to expand my pallet and satisfy my taste buds! Would definitely recommend them to anyone wanting to enjoy some fine dinning."Tasty food  thoroughly  enjoyed  each  and every bite  ??  expecting  agas  in  Dallas"Amazing tikka , and everything was good and great customer service.""After 6 months of not being able to dine inside, I was fortunate to re enter and experience their wonderful food. They have skimped on quality despite the economy and they also had a very elegant ambiance. A definite recommendation."Good food good service good peopleGood food good service and good people"BEST FOOD IN THE WORlD, HOUSTON""Best food nice atmosphere
We have group we really enjoying
Go for food with best service from Noureen"We went to Aghas last night and it was my best experience at any restaurant Hussain and Simran took care of me really well! From making sure I get my tables reserved"Overall, I had a great dining experience at Agra’s! Though this is not the first time that I have visited here from Dallas, both the service and the food have improved each and every time! Hussain, our server, was especially courteous and extremely welcoming to our large party and was willing to accommodate for all of our requests! Needless to say, I will be returning!""First off this has been one of the cleanest if not THE cleanest restaurant I have been to. The service is super genuine! (Ridwan, Hussian, Sufiyan) were absolutely amazing guys! If you are in Houston and you want to taste authentic desi food. Then you have to try Aga’s!

P.s please come to Dallas!""Not only do they have the best Desi food in town, they have best service for any desi restaurant I have been to. Everyone is friendly, courteous and seems to enjoy what they do. Sufiyan especially was great in helping us find a table that accommodated our family and made sure we were well taken care of throughout the visit. Aa for food, their goat chops are the best so is everything else. Only thing I dodnt like was their masala chai but now they have Gurr Chai which is pretty good. They are always spot on with everything."I came here with my sister to try this place out for the first time. I gotta say...it was the best experience. The waiter Andrea and manager Sufiyan recommended dishes for us. We were impressed ! The services they provided was pure and kind. I felt Very welcomed in the place. They went above and beyond. The foood was Amazing ! It was better than what I expected."By far, the best customer service ever received! Our waitress, Andrea, was super helpful when picking out our dish since it was our first time visiting. The manager Sufiyan showed outstanding customer service as well and made sure our food was brought out quick. As for the food, YOU MUST COME AND TRY IT FOR YOURSELF! You will not regret it! Everything was so tasty and I can’t wait to come back again!""I go to Aga's for their ambiance,  service and their famous goat chops. The staff will take car of you order from the table and service is quick, even on the busiest of days. They have opened dining at a lower capacity due to COVID 19.
I usually get the bar b q platter and add goat chops to it. If you are a meat lover, vegetarian, or have kids dining with you, you wont be disappointed. get the kids mango Lassi, yourself a mango mojito and save some space for falooda (dessert).""Absolutely Amazing! Our waiter, Hussain, was wonderful, attentive & knowledgeable. Food was exception, very impressed. Other than the Combos, the platters seem to be meant for Family Style Dining.

They've exceeded the minimum for social distancing... They take the temperature of everyone walking in, tables are distanced more than 6' apart & there's plenty of walking room so other guests are not walking near your table. There's a No Contact  QR Code to view the menu.

Will come back any time I'm in the area!""We drove almost 3:30 hours to eat good food and it was what we were looking for. We would like to thank all of you hut specially simran who really helped us to order food what we were trying to eat, the way they make food is different and delicious, price is bit higher than then other places but it's like you get what you pay for. Also Sufiyan has a good Customer service skills he knows how to take care of you. We were also looking for chicken kata tak but they don't have it, hope they have it next time when we go back.

;-)"Great food. Always consistent. Service is great too. This is one of our spots we frequently eat at!Good serviceBEST CLEAN RESTAURANT/NO.1 CUSTOMERS SERVICE /BEST CATERING CHEFF /BIG ELEGANT BANQUET HALLThe food is so tasty! Love it so my much. The supervisor Sufiyan is very friendly and he cares about customer a lot. Thank you again!Took the family here. They welcomed us so well. The environment was kind and friendly. Sufiyan the manager and Noreen our server were excellent in service and cordial. The food is unbelievably awesome. Words cannot do it enough justice. Rest assured our family of 7 will be returning here. I will strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone.Good food very nice insideVery clean and also friendly food is fresh and goodThe best Pakistani restaurant in town. They always provide great quality of service and amazing food.

We had to wait for over 40 minutes but wait is worth it"It was my first time at Aga’s. Noureen was the one who took my order over the phone.
she was the one who helped with the menu. They way she explained me was amazing that really made it easy to select the food from the menu. And when the food came was the perfect ??
Really i am surprised with the service and quality of the food

He was so nice and I’ll definitely be coming again with family and friends. Great customer service!!!! 5/5I had the best experience here because of Sufiyan. A great hard working man with a great personality! Thank you so much my family and i will be coming back for sure!"The Food from here is always great. Dine in or takeout, whatever it may be. The only concern sometime I have is the delay while picking up. You stay inline or waiting in the car.""Due to the excellent ratings, I have been wanting to try Aga’s for some time now. I was left with mixed impressions.

I ordered take out during Covid-19 restrictions, and was delighted by Mr. Hussein’s patient explanation of different items on the menu. He clearly took pride in his menu and understood the value of good customer service. He talked to me as if I was the only customer that mattered and there were no other customer - this customer service at the level of Zappos.com.

My order of chicken malai boti, goat hyderabadi karahi, naan, and roti were promptly ready when I arrived at the restaurant. I was eager to try to food upon reaching home.

The chicken malai boti was good. They were by an large soft, but stringy in some portions. Chicken kebabs are difficult to make because they can quickly get over-cooked, dry, and stringy in the high heat of a tandoor. While malai boti kebab were not over cooked, I would have preferred them to be juicier. I have to admit that  chicken kebabs are not ideal for take out as they continue to cook in the residual heat on the way home rather than when they are consumed at the restaurant table upon right after leaving the tandoor.

The goat Hyderabadi karahi was a drier form of karahi. The potion size was generous and meat was well cooked and very soft. But the dish was swimming in oil. There was only so much I could eat in one sitting because of the amount of oil in it. I hail from the Indian subcontinent and am used to our oily and spicy cuisine and yet for me this was too much oil.

The naan and chapati were ok. They were a little on the chewy side. But that could also be a result of them being packed in aluminum foil for take out and getting a little moist in the trapped steam.

Over all, I was impressed by the service. But I did not feel the uncontrollable desire to have little more, and then a little more that good Indo-Pak food can elicit in me. The food was solid, but not great. For that I shall give 4 stars and shall try items from their menu and update my review.

P.S. -  The Hyderabadi goat karahi was so oily and spicy that I felt uncomfortable in the stomach after having it and had trouble sleeping due to an oppressive heat inside my body. I was compelled to take another star away from my rating and would not recommend this dish to be had in the summer months, specially for dinner.""Immediately upon entry, the smell of various spices send you to another side of the world. Over 1000+ reviews and 4.5 stars? You bet you you have something to look forward to. Even during covid19 where they only do takeouts, you can see a long line of people waiting to receive their food to satisfy their cravings.

Let me say one thing, these guys are no doubt the #1 Indian restaurant in Houston. You can waste your time elsewhere like I have done in the past, but I'm certain you'll never go anywhere else unless it's for a new adventure once you have tried Aga's.

I am a regular here and often take my clients and friends. During the previous week, a good friend of mine commented that she hasn't had authentic Indian food in Houston, while her husband commented that he was not crazy about Indian food. That made me set myself on a mission to prove them wrong. When I first reached out to Aga's, I was pretty bummed out that they were only doing takeouts. However, as I was a regular, Sal and Sulfiayan, the managers, stepped up and made an exception to open up their banquet hall for us to dine in.

Our party of 6 ordered various items. My go to here everytime is the goat chops and goat vindaloo. The chops are excellent and cleaned to where there is no gamy taste like at other restaurants. The vindaloo is wonderful as well if you can handle the heat as it is spicy. The garlic nan is also a favorite. At the request of my guests, I had even ventured to the dark side and tried goat brains, which turned out interesting.

With the phenomenal service and food, my guests changed their minds about Indian food in Houston and in general. As Sal had explained to us ""Aga"" means ""the first"", and true to their name, they are pioneers of their craft. They have been in business for years and the reviews don't lie. Give Aga's a try whenever a try you want to good authentic Indian food with great service!""Our first time at Aga’s was amazing!! Sufiyan, the floor manager, was very accommodating and took the time to make sure our experience was one of a kind. The food was the best Indian food we’ve had, tastes very authentic. My favorite was chicken tikki masala (must try!), BBQ platter was great too! If you never had Indian food before make sure this is the first place you go to."My boyfriend had never tried Indian before. He was pleasantly surprised by his experience. Food was very good. I would go again in a heart beat."Possibly the best chicken malai kababs I've have in 20 years in the US! We are on an RV trip and were driving through Houston and decided to look for an Indian restaurant to pick up food. We chose Aga's because of the reviews. Our normally picky 7 year old also loved the kababs! In his words: I'm not just mindblown, I'm blown away!""

Aga's deserves every single high review and star it has on its reviews!"The food here is always good. Best Indian food I have had in Houston so farSurprisingly the food is just amazing...TAST FOOD ALWAYS AND CLEAN RESTAURANTAgas restaurant is the best Indian restaurant serving the most delicious Indian halal food in Houston. Their food and service is the best in the industry. Everyone is so friendly and well organized. My wife and I observed while waiting for our order that every customer is greeted with smile. Even the owner/manager helping out customers in line to pick up orders. Highly efficient and highly recommended.Service is very good. All staff is best. All is up to date. Taste is very good. But price is high and quantity is less."AGAS AGAS AGAS
I was craving some Indian/Pakistani food one day and i remembered my cousin was always, raving about this restaurant called AGAS. (11842 WILCREST DRIVE, houston tx.)so my wife, sister, brother-in-law, and i decided to go into Houston and see for ourselves what the big deal was about this place and let me tell you i was not disappointed at all! This Probably one of the best experiences i have ever had in my entire life. The service was unmatched! We walked in and the tables we all removed due to social distancing and we thought man... Were in trouble we drove all this way and we cant dine in... I know, i should have called. But then a young well dressed, groomed man approached us and noticed us ""lingering"". I told him we drove all this way from Louisiana to try his food and we were hoping to dine in, the manager (??Sufiyan Patel??) said well in that case, we will set you up a private table in the back and you can dine in. The food was incredible. And the experience more so.
I recommend everything on the menu.
We ordered.
Chicken masala
Goat biriyani
Goat karahi
Chicken lollipops ??????
Garlic naan.
Do yourself a favor and check out this place!
Shout out to all my syeds out there!
????????????"Food was good.Chicken masala was tasty. Only weird thing was rice isn't included.Phenomenal!"I heard Agas on the radio talking about good food, great service and about the cleanliness so I decided to call Agas restaurant and placed my order. The person who took my order was a very pleasant and well organized person. When I walked in they had a cool foot paddle on the door to open the door with foot rather than the hands. Upon arrival I noticed that the restaurant was loaded with hand sanitizers everywhere. Employees were wearing masks and gloves. I was greeted with a smile and the checkout procesa was efficient. Even the staff member took my order to my car. The food was very good, not too spicy not so oily. It was exactly how it was described on the radio. Keep up the great job Agas and thank you DJ AJ at the radio station for recommending Agas on your show. Will be back soon.""Agas is the best Indian  Pakistani Restaurant and offers the best chicken tikka masala and the best chicken and goat biryani in Houston May be in Texas. They also have the best Garlic naan and the best mango lassi. We placed an order to go and the service was absolutely the best. They recommended their lamb chops and we are so happy we ordered it, it was simply one of the best (if not the best) dish we ever had. The service is very good. Unfortunately they are not open for dine in but they are just being safe. We received discount on our order as well. The prices are pretty decent.

We will be ordering again,""Nice place though crowded most times. Food is great and prices reasonable. However, the grilled goat chops, I used to love, has turned a little more greasy during the covid-19 takeouts. The recipe or the must have changed.""Very good food for the price, especially with their recent 15% discount for to-go orders."Awesome food nice people very nice environmentBest Pakistani place in town"Good service, Good Quantity, Good Quality, and Reasonable price, these are the 4 pillars of an excellent restaurant and Aga's nailed every single one of these pillars.""Originally from Lahore Pakistan.
On our visit to Houston from Dallas, we were told by friends to visit Aga's Restaurant on Wilcrest. So decided to show up for a nice meal before heading back to Dallas. When we got there, we saw many customers going in and out with food in their hands. well we came to know that the dining is not open but takeout is available. So we ended up ordering it to go. The staff is so friendly, polite and professional. Even though the restaurant was fairly busy, we got our food in about 25 mins. Now that we have the food where do we eat? So we decided to open the trunk of our SUV and enjoy our food. As we started eating, one of the employees came and brought us plastic ware and waters and told us to let him know if we need anything else. As we got to half way of eating our food another employee of Aga's saw us eating from the back of our vehicle as he was loading the food trays in to a customers vehicle, he stopped by and asked us if we needed anything. I have been to many businesses and getting that kind of attention from employees is rare. Kudos to the management for finding such a caring people.

Now let me tell you about the food.
Between 6 of us we ordered:
(We got some complimentary salad, raita & chutney)
Lamb chops 10/5 (unbelievably amazing, we had to order more as we were eating)
Beef nihari  5/5 (very good)
Peshawari kabab karachi 5/5 (simply awesome)
Beef bihari kabab 4/5 (not bad)
Chicken biryani 5/5 (OMG good)
Nans 5/5 (very soft)
Puri paratha 3/5 (tasty but little oily)
SERVICE 10/5 (SIMPLY INCREDIBLE)
After we ate we ordered more food to take back with us which was also great.

This place is as good as it gets!""Great food, great services and great restaurant to take clients.""Amazing experience!! We came all the way from San Antonio and were unable to place our order via phone or online. Mr. Sufiyan(manager) took our order curbside and personally delivered the order to our car, we really appreciate his dedication towards his customers. We were also provided bottled water free of charge. Thank you so much and can’t wait to dine in once Covid restrictions are lifted."Not just sayin This but this place is perfect. Ppl are nice there and service was great .100% recommend"Great service and pricing, mouthwatering dishes. Would definitely reccomend."Very courtious and prompt service. Food very good not overly spicy.  Thank you."We have great time at Agas. Manager Sufiyan is a great guy very friendly and kind. We came to Houston and were eating outside to which he offered us everything we wanted with kindness and gratitude.

Sufiyan you rock at Aga’s and we enjoyed your service.""Genuinely you cannot top Aga’s. I look forward to enjoying the food in restaurant when they allow it again, but if it was that good just ordering, google needs to make 6 stars for the actual dine-in experience. Everything here is delicious - you cannot go wrong! Well...actually looking over this place is indeed the one wrong you would be making."It’s the best place for Halal desi food in Houston!One of the finest restaurants in Stafford area. I loved the goat biriyani from here. Really enjoyed the food ."The best Indian and the best Pakistani restaurant in Houston. I don't know the differences between the two. They are known for their butter chicken and goat chops and you can not go wrong with it. We ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka masala grilled goat chops, garlic naan, chicken fried rice, mango mojito for me and mango lassi for my wife. We loved all dishes. The grilled goat chops were heavenly good. The service exceptionally good. this is very high on my list. it's located southside of Houston and North part of Sugar Land. Since our last visit back in March, we have been very regular with takeout orders from this restaurant. We also use Ubereats and Doordash. We're a big fan of this restaurant and have been telling our family and friends about this restaurant."Great customer service! Hussain was amazing! Helped customize our order and was a huge helpAmazing food...Loved it..Omg..one of the best places in Texas..no one can beat their food...hooked on them permanently...thank you for best food"When my wife and I moved to Missouri City, one thing we were really excited about was the large number of local Indian food restaurants, because that's one of our favorite cuisines. It took us about a year to try almost all of them, giving each one a few chances to prove their worth before we settled on a clear winner.
This location is that winner. In particular, I would highly suggest the Chicken Makhani, especially if you're someone who is fond of the extremely popular Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken options at typical restaurants."Love the biryani but I would stay away from curries as too much oil.Don't miss the goat chops and kabobs.Awesome customer service!! Goat chops were amazing"Yesterday was our Wedding anniversary and we were so looking forward to dinner that we ordered from Aga's. We were so disappointed with the food. There were 5 main dishes, Except Biryani everything else was horrible:(
Never buy any of Tikka Masala dish - terrible, curry is simply just tomato paste. And to make things worse, I called them to complain, their Manager(forgetting the name!), is just saying ' oh you didn't like the food, so sorry' and that's it!! I was telling him your menu says 'Spicy' and it was just tomato paste and sweet, he is telling me everybody's spice level is different - what the heck!! Then what is your 'Spicy' in the description means- oh my!! I am sooo mad, they do NOT know what is customer service- really expected better than this! Spoiled our Anniversary!
Do not think I am ever going to go or order in my life!!"Great food. I eat there every time I visit houstan. The manager sufyaan made the experience even better for us. Great service and great food."Food is good. One of the best places to eat Indian food. Try their biryani, chicken boti kabob, goat and chicken peshwari dish. They still haven't started dine in service right now. But even their to go orders are packed."Always delicious!The goat meat was delicious! ??"100% recommended
Richa is best sales associate ask for her service, You will find amazing food and great experience ??""What I love about this restaurant is that the food is not only good, but consistently good. The menu is so extensive, that you can try something new every time. White Chicken Kabab Karahi? Yes please! Overall, highly recommend!"Excellent food from the goat chops to every curry that I've tried.  Super friendly staff and good sized portions.This is the Indian version Chick-fil-A for service. Absolutely terrific. Delicious food that is flavorful and makes you want more. This is truly the best and I am not overhyping it. Go try it!"My family and love Agas. Especially the amazing service and hospitality from Sufiyan, the floor manager. He is always going above and beyond to ensure my mother is well taken care of and ask about my brothers. The combination of amazingly delicious food and excellent customer service is the reason we will continue to come to Agas. Do yourself a favor, treat your stomach and come to Aga's! - Monroe!"
